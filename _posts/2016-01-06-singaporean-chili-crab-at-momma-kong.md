Singaporean Chilli Crab at Momma Kong

We were around Marina Bay area and craved for chilli crab (who isn't when you're in Singapore?). I've had recommendations for Long Beach and No Signboard, but this time around we need to get somewhere quickly as it's already late, and preferably with MRT.

Momma Kong's (http://www.mommakongs.com/) is in Chinatown (34 Mosque St, Singapore 059512) and very close to the MRT stop Chinatown. I have to admit I'm a sucker for tiny places like this, and I absolutely adore the small joint feel of it.

The chili crab was amazing! We had a menu for two, which consisted of two crabs (we chose the grilled crab as the other one - not so wise choice), grilled squid, a choice of veggie, and 4 mantou breads. 

Service was quick and pretty good (one waiter was awesome, the other one not so much - hence it evened out). Place was clean, it accepts card payment as well.

Totally recommended.
